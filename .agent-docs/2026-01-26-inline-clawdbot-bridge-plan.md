# Plan: Inline ↔ Clawdbot bridge research + doc (2026-01-26)

1. ✅ Verify local Clawdbot sources (repo + docs) and identify the key gateway/protocol/plugin references to use.
2. ✅ Extract and summarize Gateway WS protocol, auth, sessions, chat/agent methods, and channel plugin architecture relevant to a bridge.
3. ✅ Design the Inline bridge integration (architecture options, mapping, security, deployment, testing).
4. ✅ Write the comprehensive bridge document to `.agent-docs/2026-01-26-inline-clawdbot-bridge.md`.
