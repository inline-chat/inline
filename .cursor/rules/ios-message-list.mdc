In iOS, we use UIKit for the chat view screen (except for the navigation bar which is in SwiftUI)

# Chat view
The UIKit root for the chat view is at: apple/InlineIOS/Chat/ChatViewUIKit.swift

# Collection View
It uses a collection view in apple/InlineIOS/Chat/MessagesCollectionView.swift which is transformed to be upside down to support bottom-up scrolling bahaviour in a chat app. 

# Insets
It calculates content insets manually considering compose height, safe areas, keyboard, navigation bars, etc. 

# Message View
It's at apple/InlineIOS/Message/UIMessageView.swift which is wrapped in a collection view cell in apple/InlineIOS/Chat/MessageCollectionViewCell.swift which adds the name and avatar and manages cell reuse.
