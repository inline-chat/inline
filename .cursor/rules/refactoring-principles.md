# Refactoring Principles

When refactoring code, always prioritize making it:

## Clean
- Remove unnecessary complexity and dead code
- Eliminate code duplication through proper abstraction
- Follow consistent naming conventions and formatting
- Keep functions and classes focused on single responsibilities

## Readable
- Use descriptive variable and function names that explain intent
- Add clear comments for complex business logic
- Structure code with logical flow and proper indentation
- Break down large functions into smaller, well-named components

## Extendable
- Design with future requirements in mind
- Use interfaces and protocols to enable flexibility
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Create modular components that can be easily modified or replaced
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable
- Prefer composition over inheritance for better flexibility

Always consider the long-term maintainability and the ease with which other developers can understand and extend the codebase.
