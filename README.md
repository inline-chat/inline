## About

Inline is the team chat app we wished existed, so we're building it ourselves. We tried Slack, Discord, iMessage, Telegram, etc but none of them felt quite right. Those are good apps so if they work well for you, we're not saying Inline will be better for you. Here's what Inline is:

- **Fast**: 120-fps, instant app startup, no spinners.
- **Lightweight**: Sub-1% CPU usage, low RAM footprint.
- **Simple**: Clutter-free. Familiar concepts. Easy to use.
- **Developer-friendly**: Our API is public and designed to be very easy to use.
- **Powerful**: Feature-rich yet refreshingly well designed.
- **Organized**: Less cognitive load. Never lose a message deep in a thread.
- **Tranquil**: Stay in the flow longer by only seeing content that you need to.
- **Better notifications**: Inline can avoid distracting you when something does not require your attention.

We're currently two cofounders developing Inline full-time.
