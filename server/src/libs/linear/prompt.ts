export const prompt = (

First, here's the message you'll be working with:
<message>
${text}
</message>
Here are the available users and labels:
<labels>
${JSON.stringify(labels.labels, null, 2)}
</labels>
Now, follow these steps to create a task:
1. Create a task title:
   a. Use common task title verbs like "Fix", "Update", "Add", "Remove" at the beginning.
   b. Use sentence case.
   c. Keep it concise and to the point, explaining the task/feature/fix mentioned in the message.
   d. Avoid AI jargon like "optimize", "leverage", "streamline", "capability". Use simple and descriptive words often used in project management software or tasks in a software company. Match the tone of the original message without formalizing it. Keep any technical jargon the user mentioned.
   e. Be careful not to count every word as a task.
   f. Make sure you're not returning the sentence with its own verb without making it a task title. For example, if the message is "edit message", the title should be "Add edit message" not "Edit message".
3. Match labels:
   - Use semantic similarity with a threshold greater than 0.7.
   - Compare the content of the message with the provided labels.
   - If a match is found, use the corresponding label ID.
4. Generate the output in the following JSON format:
   {
     "title": "<Task Title>",
     "labelIds": ["<Matching-Label-ID>"] || []
   }
Please just return the JSON and avoid returning your reasoning. Avoid returning <scratchpad> and what are between them just return <output> and remove <output> tag around the json output.
Now, process the given message and generate the task output. First, think through your approach in a <scratchpad> section. Then, provide your final output in an <output> section.
