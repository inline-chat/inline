# Developers

Inline currently exposes two API entry points.

## Bot HTTP API

- Best for simpler bot workflows and alerts.
- Request/response over HTTP.
- Good fit for lightweight automations.

## Full Realtime API

- Best for full two-way interactions and richer bot behavior.
- WebSocket RPC with live state sync.
- Recommended when your bot behaves like an active participant in chats.

See: [Realtime API](/docs/realtime-api)

## Quick Start
